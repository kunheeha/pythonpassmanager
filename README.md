# Password Manager

A completely offline password manager that encrypts passwords and stores them in a database on your local machine.

- GUI - Tkinter
- Database - SQLite (used sqlite since it doesn't require server and is self-contained)
- Password encryption - cryptography.fernet
- Master password hashing - SHA-256



## Features

Accounts that have multiple associated passwords 
(for example, bank accounts with digital security password, phone banking password, memorable word, online banking password etc) 
can be created to store each of the different passwords alongside their relevant password prompts in a single 'account' instance 
as well as just generic accounts with a single associated password.
